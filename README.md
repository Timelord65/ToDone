# Getting Started with To do App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm run server_start: 

This script runs the server.js file for backend-testing. Will have to be replaced with a proper start:server script later. 

##### The remaining scripts are all there as part of the CRA defaults and will be changed as per requirement. 


## Installation Process:

As of now, running `npm install` should be enough for this project.
